## WebGL3DText
This repository showcases the use of WebGL to create a visually stunning 3D scene with text and various geometries. The text is created using the TextGeometry module and rendered with a Matcap material that uses a texture loaded with TextureLoader. The geometries include torus, sphere, box, and cone, and are randomly positioned, rotated, and scaled. The scene is interactive and can be explored using the OrbitControls module. The Lil-GUI module is also used to provide a user interface for adjusting scene parameters.
